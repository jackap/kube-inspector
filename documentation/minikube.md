# Minikube
Tool for local development of kubernetes clusters. It replicates the behaviour of
a production deployment with focus on
development. 

We decided to employ this tool as it makes it easy to test
and verify our tools. Also, it is 
possible to delete and recreate the 
cluster in a matter of minutes, and 
we can have independent results.
